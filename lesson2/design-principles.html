                        The reason that I chose Men's Wearhouse's website for my white space and clean design
                        is because of how easy the website is to look at.  It is very simple but also very professional
                        looking.  They went for simple colors and a simple layout, but links they have still catch your eye.
                        They also utilize white spaces for the boxes with the "Starting At" prices.

                        Callaway Golf

                    <p>
                        Callaway Golf's website has very good contrast.  I don't think there is any better color contrast than
                        black and white.  The contrast helps with navigating the site as well.  You have a advertisement of a golf 
                        club with a black background, but the link to take you to the club has a white background inside
                        of the black background so it really stands out and makes it easy for users to find.

                    <h4>
                        Best Buy

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Best Buy's website is a great example of applying the principle alignment to a website.  The bottom two images
                        are perfectly aligned with each other and they also stay aligned with the single image above them.  You can see 
                        the "You viewed" text is also aligned perfect on the left of the boxes below and above.
